  <em>
    Hello! My name is Anne Angus (she/her) and I am an information professional.
  </em>
</p>
<br>

> // 🤔  What on earth is an "information professional"??
<p>
 I call myself an information professional because my background in developing, applying, and teaching elements of technology is diverse. I have developed CMS websites, performed data audits, built custom APIs, and instructed users in technology applicaiton. My work impacts different aspects of digital information ecosystems, and so I feel the title "information professional" best explains what I do. I am an expert in managing information and I use an array of tools to that end.
</p>
<br>

> // 🌱  What am I doing now? 
<p>
Currently I am writing APIs in Javascript to expand functionality within Adobe Acrobat. Acrobat is a program that my organization utilizes regularly and my work is focused on improving efficiency and accuracy. My future goal is to translate many of these functions over to web applications that will better integrate with existing systems.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not playing with code, I'm thoroughly documenting my work so that others can easily use it. I love designing instruction and teaching others how to use or troubleshoot technology. The office joke is that I am the "IT First Responder." And they are not wrong!
</p>
<br>

> // 🤷‍♀️  Who am I outside of a computering-instructionaling geek? 
<p>
And when I'm not teaching, I'm paragliding, training my two Aussies, or creating woodburn illustrations. You got to get away from the screen every now and then!</p>
